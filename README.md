## A tribute to the German women's football 1. Bundesliga

The goal of the project is to present a multi-page dashboard that summarizes the 2022/23 season of the German Women's Bundesliga, but also goes into detail about match, team and player statistics. Together with links to team and player websites and the embedding of images, fans and officials should be able to get an overview with the desired level of detail. Furthermore, a summary of the current season (2023/24) is provided following each match day.

Please view the attached 7z file, which contains a video demonstration of the dashboard.
